Platform agnostic Rust driver for Sensirion SVM40 device with gas, temperature and humidity sensors 
based on the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal) traits.

## Sensirion SVM40

Sensirion SVM40 has 2nd generation low-power accurate SGP40 gas sensor for air quality application 
and SHT40 sensor measuring temperature and humidity. The sensor uses IÂ²C interface and measures 
VOC (*Total Volatile Organic Compounds*)

Evaluation board: https://www.sensirion.com/cn/environmental-sensors/evaluation-kit-sek-svm40/

## Development status
The sensor supports starting and stopping measurement as well as gathering the values but
there are still work to do:
- Improve documentation
- Moving into using Embedded-hal 1.x
- Improve crate module tests
- Maybe add async support (most waits are so short that it might not make sense)
- Add VOC states management
- Add VOC parameters management
- Implement storing of input parameters
